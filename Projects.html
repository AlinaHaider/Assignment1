                    <p>Bookshops are important in our daily lives especially for students on campus. Bookshop consists of various items such as books, stationary, uniform, electronics, printing machines etc. Shopkeepers are used to cater the need of customers which includes thousands of students as well as teachers visiting the bookshop daily in-order to purchase something. 
                        As there are only few shopkeepers to deal with the customers so make a bill by hand and keeping record of stock by hand is very difficult so by monitoring the situation it would be beneficial to design a billing and record keeping system for them. In this way owner would be able to run business successfully and efficiently.  This system helps avoids any sort of troublesome experience for the customers such as time delay in billing during rush hour. This system also provides data security and storage facility by securing the data safely in database to avoid any data loss.
